## Project Overview

This project outlines a secure campus network architecture for an educational institution. The design integrates multiple security layers, providing secure access for students, faculty, and staff while safeguarding sensitive information from potential cyber threats.

Key components of the project include:
- **Campus LAN and WLAN architecture**
- **Network segmentation and firewall configuration**
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**
- **Secure network protocols (e.g., VPN, TLS, 802.1X)**
- **Endpoint protection and secure communication**
- **Data encryption at rest and in transit**

## Cybersecurity Principles

This project adheres to the following core cybersecurity principles:
1. **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users.
2. **Integrity**: Protecting data from unauthorized alteration or tampering.
3. **Availability**: Ensuring that the network is operational and accessible to authorized users when needed.
4. **Authentication and Authorization**: Verifying the identity of users and systems and granting access based on permissions.
5. **Non-repudiation**: Ensuring that actions taken on the network cannot be denied later.

## Network Design

### Overview

The campus network design includes:
- **Core Network**: Data center and critical infrastructure.
- **Edge Network**: Faculty, student, and staff devices.
- **Wireless Network (WLAN)**: Secure Wi-Fi access points for campus-wide connectivity.
- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**: Separate zone for public-facing services like web servers, email servers, etc.
- **Firewall**: Perimeter security to prevent unauthorized access.

### Network Segmentation

- **VLANs (Virtual LANs)**: The network is segmented into multiple VLANs, ensuring that sensitive data is isolated from other network traffic.
  - **VLAN 10**: Faculty & Staff Network
  - **VLAN 20**: Student Network
  - **VLAN 30**: Guest Network (Limited access)
  - **VLAN 40**: Admin/Management Network (Highly restricted)

### Network Topology

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the campus network and apply cybersecurity configurations:

1. **Install Core Network Infrastructure**:
   - Set up the main router, switches, and firewalls.
   - Create the VLANs as per the network design.
   
2. **Configure Network Devices**:
   - Configure the routers and switches with the appropriate IP addressing scheme.
   - Set up DHCP, DNS, and routing protocols.

3. **Set Up Wireless Access Points**:
   - Secure the wireless network with WPA3 and apply appropriate VLAN tags to wireless traffic.

4. **Configure Firewalls and Security Policies**:
   - Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to limit unauthorized access.
   - Set up the firewall rules based on your network segmentation (e.g., deny all inbound traffic except necessary ports).

5. **Implement Intrusion Detection/Prevention**:
   - Configure IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for potential threats.

6. **Set Up VPN Access**:
   - Configure a VPN gateway for secure remote access to the campus network.

7. **Deploy Endpoint Security**:
   - Ensure that endpoint protection (e.g., antivirus, EDR) is installed on all devices connected to the network.

8. **Enable Encryption**:
   - Set up TLS encryption for communication over the network.
   - Implement disk encryption for sensitive devices.

## Security Measures

To ensure the network remains secure, the following measures have been implemented:

- **Firewalls**: Firewalls are deployed at the perimeter and internal network layers to filter traffic and block unauthorized access.
- **Authentication**: Strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and 802.1X authentication for device access.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**: Monitoring for potential network intrusions and blocking suspicious activities.
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption protocols are used to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to limit access based on user roles.
- **Regular Audits**: Security audits are conducted regularly to ensure compliance with security policies.

## Testing and Monitoring

- **Network Performance**: Tools like **Wireshark** and **SolarWinds** can be used for traffic analysis and monitoring network performance.
- **Security Testing**: Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments using tools like **Nessus** or **Metasploit** to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems such as **Splunk** or **ELK Stack** for centralized logging and real-time monitoring.

## Troubleshooting

- **Network Connectivity**: Use commands like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `netstat` to diagnose connectivity issues.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Review firewall rules to ensure the correct traffic is being allowed/blocked.
- **IDS/IPS Alerts**: Check logs and fine-tune the IDS/IPS system to reduce false positives.
